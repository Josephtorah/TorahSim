# THE DEUTERONOMY WALK 9b (8b's form by sed) — the docket parts' shared helper: the dump's addresses in order (the source of truth for coverage — a part can never invent
# an address), a SPEC of (matcher, verdict, note) rows applied first-match, the part's slice asserted fully matched. R(prefix, lo, hi) matches
# 'prefix:n' for lo <= n <= hi; a bare string matches one address. The notes name the cell of cold_run_blessing_and_curse.py (F1 the_discipline_retold, F2 the_land_watered_by_heaven, F3 the_second_paragraph, F4 the_borders_and_the_dread, F5 the_blessing_and_the_curse,
# F6 the_readback) on LAW rows, or the callee's cell by CALL.
